# Auto-Mod Roller 
Weightless is a widget that automatically rolls for desired mods. The mod rolling button only works in the cash currency tab. Once the roll for mod button is clicked there is a 3-second delay until the program starts. Choose the currecy you wish to use and hover over the item within the 3-second window. The program will stop once the desired mod has been found. Hold "alt" to stop the program at any time. 


## Installation 
1. Click the green (code) button and download as zip. 
2. Extract the contents to a file location of your choosing.
3. Run Modroller.exe or python source file. 


## Usage
- Open the "Modroller.exe" to start the program. 
- You might get an anti-virus prompt to scan the file before you can open it. If this issue persists add it as an exception to your anti-virus software. 
- Change your __Path of Exile__ settings to __Windows Fullscreen__ or __Windowed__ mode.
